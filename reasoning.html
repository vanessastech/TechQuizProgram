                        <p>Q - Driving <br> <br> 
                            It's safer to hit whatever is in front than lose total control of the car.
                            Slamming on the brakes at a high speed locks the back tires, which causes you to roll.
                            Swerving can make you roll.

                        <p>Q - Underwater <br> <br>
                            Rolling down the windows leads to an easy escape. 
                            Using the metal rods from the headrests can easily break the corner of the window creating an opening.
                            Sometimes the doors are unable to open.

                            If the black bear is unbothered, it is best to walk away slowly backwards without making any noise and avoiding eye contact.
                            You can't fear it or let it know you're scared.

                            If the black bear is aggressive, you should act larger. 
                            If you run, it will chase you down.
                            If you play dead, there is a chance that the bear will think you're prey.

                        <p>Q - Berries <br> <br>
                            Purple berries are the best option; they still may be toxic but are better than white or yellow.
                            Yellow and white berries are more likely to be toxic than purple. 
                            You should only eat small amounts.

                        It's a lot safer to try find shelter at night, but if you can't it's good to create your own.
                        If you carry on moving at night, it can be a risk. You may stumble across danger.

                        <p>Q - Water <br> <br> 
                        Drinking water from any still source isn't good. The water should always be flowing. 
                        So, if you see a stream, drinking from there is the best option.

                        <p>Q - Rip Current <br> <br>
                        It's best to stay calm and swim parallel to the shore.
                        Rip currents are powerful and can be challenging to swim against, it can get you exhausted and you may not get anywhere.
                        Waiting may not be effictive in all cases. Sometimes taking immediate action is crutial.

                        <p>Q - Lighting Storm <br> <br>
                        It's best to find an area which is at a lower elevation without any isolated trees.
                        Lighting tends to strike the tallest objects in an area. 
                        Lying flat on the ground can be dangerous because you still have a chance of getting shocked.
                        Aswell as it can expose you to ground currents.

                        <p>Q - Boat <br> <br>
                        The boat can provide buoyancy and can make it easier to stay afloat.
                        It also makes it easier for rescuers to spot you.
                        Swimming long distances can be exhausting and can increase risk of hypothermia if you're in cold water.
